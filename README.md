# APTGen
A simple .exe GUI tool to create random Aptamer DNA sequences of specified length and GC content (Windows executable available)

I made this as a quick side project to help anyone who wants a head start on making a random library of aptamers.
Please feel free to use my code and improve it any way you like.
